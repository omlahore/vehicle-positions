# Development Guide

This guide is for contributors who want to run, verify, and iterate on the current Go server in this repository.

## Scope

The current implementation focuses on:

- ingesting location reports (`POST /api/v1/locations`)
- serving GTFS-RT vehicle positions (`GET /gtfs-rt/vehicle-positions`)
- exposing basic server status (`GET /api/v1/admin/status`)

## Prerequisites

- Go (matching `go.mod` toolchain)
- Docker + Docker Compose
- `curl`

## Quick Start (Docker)

From the repository root:

1. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   make up
   ```

2. Verify server health:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

3. Run a smoke test (posts one location, then fetches status + feed JSON):

   ```bash
   make smoke
   ```

4. Stop the stack when done:

   ```bash
   make down
   ```

## Local Server Run (without Docker server container)

You can run Postgres in Docker and run the Go server directly:

1. Start only database:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db
   ```

2. Export environment variables:

   ```bash
   export PORT=8080
   export DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/vehicle_positions?sslmode=disable'
   export STALENESS_THRESHOLD=5m
   ```

3. Run server:

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

Migrations are applied automatically on server startup.

## Admin Web UI

The server also serves a session-authenticated admin UI at `/admin`
(dashboard, live map + trails, vehicle/user CRUD, assignments, trip history).
It's on by default; set `ADMIN_UI_ENABLED=false` if you want to run the
server with just the JSON API.

To sign in locally, seed the dev admin (`admin@test.com` / `password`) the
same way you'd seed the dev driver:

```bash
docker compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d vehicle_positions < seed_dev.sql
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080/admin/login`. For a from-scratch admin
instead of the seed one, set `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL` /
`ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` before the server's first boot — it only creates
an admin when none exist yet, so it's safe to leave set across restarts.

Deactivating a user blocks new logins immediately, but existing sessions and
tokens for that user remain valid until they expire (up to 24 hours) — this
isn't instant revocation.

If you're changing anything under `web/templates` or `web/styles/input.css`,
rebuild the compiled Tailwind CSS before checking your changes in the
browser:

```bash
make css
```

This compiles `web/styles/input.css` to `web/static/css/admin.css` (which is
what the server actually embeds and serves — the browser never sees
`input.css`) using a pinned Tailwind CLI binary (currently `v4.2.0`, see
`TAILWIND_VERSION` in the `Makefile`) that `make css` downloads to `.tools/`
on first use. CI checks in `web/static/css/admin.css` against the same
pinned version, so if you bump `TAILWIND_VERSION` in the `Makefile`, also
bump the version CI downloads in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and re-run `make
css` to regenerate the checked-in output.

Running behind a reverse proxy locally (rare, but if you're testing that
path)? Set `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` so client-IP-based rate limiting and
the session cookie's `Secure` flag look at `X-Forwarded-For` /
`X-Forwarded-Proto` instead of the raw connection.

## Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
make test
```

Notes:

- most tests are unit tests and run without external services
- DB integration tests in `store_test.go` require `DATABASE_URL` and are skipped when it is not set

## Simulating Vehicle Traffic

Use the built-in simulator to generate multiple moving vehicles:

```bash
make simulate
```

Custom example:

```bash
go run ./cmd/simulator -url http://localhost:8080 -vehicles 20 -interval 2s -duration 2m
```

## Rider Mode Smoke Test

Rider mode is off by default. Exercising it end to end means starting the
server with `RIDER_MODE_ENABLED=true` and a `GTFS_STATIC_URL`, driving riders
along a trip with the `cmd/ridersim` simulator, and reading the resulting
entities back out of `/gtfs-rt/vehicle-positions?source=rider`.

_The step-by-step commands land with `cmd/ridersim` itself; see
[`README.md`](../README.md#rider-mode-crowdsourced-positions) for the
configuration and API in the meantime._

## API Sanity Checks

### Submit one location

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/locations \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "vehicle_id": "demo-vehicle-42",
    "trip_id": "route-5-0830",
    "latitude": -1.2921,
    "longitude": 36.8219,
    "bearing": 180,
    "speed": 8.5,
    "accuracy": 12,
    "timestamp": '"$(date +%s)"'
  }'
```

### Get feed (JSON debug format)

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/gtfs-rt/vehicle-positions?format=json'
```

### Get admin status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admin/status
```

## Troubleshooting

- `connection refused` when posting locations:
  - confirm server is running on `localhost:8080`
- DB connection/migration errors:
  - check `DATABASE_URL`
  - verify Postgres container is healthy (`docker compose ps`)
- `address already in use` for `0.0.0.0:5432` when running `make up`:
   - another local Postgres is using port `5432`
   - stop that service, or update [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to map a different host port and adjust `DATABASE_URL` accordingly
- empty feed:
   - make sure timestamp is within 5 minutes of server time (this is request validation in `handlers.go`, independent of `STALENESS_THRESHOLD`)
  - ensure coordinates are valid and non-zero
